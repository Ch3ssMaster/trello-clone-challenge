## Built With

| Tecnology                               | Description                                        |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| [MATERIAL-UI](https://material-ui.com/) | Used for most of components                        |
| [React](https://reactjs.org/)           | A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. |

### About the technologies used

I'm in favor of taking advantage of the resources that are already created, even taking into account the limits it generates in the creative side, so I decided to take advantage of every resource that Material UI offers, trying not to include more code to the proyect than strictly necessary.

## How the website works

When you start the application, it starts by default with a `"To Do"` list, that includes a task: `"Learning React"`.

You can add new tasks by clicking on `"Add another Card"`, or a new list by clicking on the`"Add another list"` button.

Once several lists and tasks have been created, the application allows you to exchange the order or list tasks. It also allows you to exchange the position of the lists.

## Versioning
